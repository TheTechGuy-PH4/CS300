# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- The problems we that were attempting to solve in our projects was to able to write efficient code that could read course information from a file and store it in a data structure. Once the data was stored, we needed to be able to print the course info in alphanumeric order.
How did you approach the problem? Condsider why data structures are important to understand.
- I approached this issue by doing the reading to get a better understanding for all the data structures. Once I got an understanding for data structures, I was able to make an educated decision on which to use for the project. I think its important to understand different data structures because not all data structures are used for the same thing. Each can address a different issue that another may not. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- Three major things helped me get through some issues I had. Stackflow, Google, and testing out different ways to go about the problem. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
- I think learning how all the different data structures work and understanding how Runtime Analysis plays a major role into creating sustainable software will help me tremendously. I this will allow me to be able to make code that is more reliable and efficient. Which is always the goal.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs thta are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
- I think it has taken my skill and understanding to next level. I think to have that deeper understanding of how more complex data structures and algorithms work will help me excel to start creating ideas that I have always had in my head.
